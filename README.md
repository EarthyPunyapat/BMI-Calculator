# Tkinter BMI Calculator Project

## üéØ Project Overview

A BMI calculator built using **CustomTkinter** for doctors and nurses to easily input patient details (age, gender, height, weight), validate input, and generate a BMI report onscreen. The program prevents BMI calculation for pregnant patients and ensures user-friendly validation and feedback.
